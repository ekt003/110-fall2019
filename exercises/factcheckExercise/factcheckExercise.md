# Fact-Checking Exercise (Week 2, Tuesday 9/3)

In today's exercise, you'll research a claim reported in the news to determine its accuracy. 

## Instructions

In August of 2019, following a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, multiple news organizations reported that President Trump had claimed that violent videogames were one of the causes of increased real-world violence. 

For this exercise, you'll need to determine two things:  whether the president actually made that claim, and whether is there evidence to support that such a causal relationship exists.  

I have created a quiz in myCourses to collect your answers to to this exercise. It has four questions:

1) Did the president make this claim? 
2) Where did you find evidence to support your answer in #1?
3) Before beginning this exercise, did you believe that there was a causal relationship between violent videogames and real-world violence?
4) After completing the exercise, did your beliefs change? Why or why not? 

You are allowed to work with other students on this, but each of you must still submit your own responses. 


## Deliverables

Complete the quiz in myCourses. You should have time to do this in class, but if not, you have until 8am tomorrow morning (Wednesday, 9/4) to turn it in.
