# Basic HTML Markup Exercise (Week 7, Tuesday 9/10)

In today's exercise, you'll complete the Introduction to HTML  on the Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) site, complete the two assessments, and upload the resulting files to myCourses. 

## Instructions

Complete the [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) guides on the MDN website, along with the two associated assessments. You can use either Codepen.io, or a desktop editor like VS Code. 


## Deliverables

Upload your completed HTML documents (just the .html pages you edited, not the accompanying files) to the myCourses Assignments dropbox by 3pm on Thursday. If you used Codepen.io, you can either export the files and submit the files from the resulting "src" subfolder, or you can provide the URL for the pen.
