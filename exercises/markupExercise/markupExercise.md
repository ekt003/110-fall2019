# Basic HTML Markup Exercise (Week 7, Tuesday 10/8)

In today's exercise, you'll complete all of the  guides from the [Introduction to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) module on the Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) site, and then complete the first assessment (the letter markup) at the end of the section. 

I recommend *skimming* the guides so that you get a general idea of the content being covered in each, and then referring back to them for detail as you work on the assessment. 

Right-click on [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lawleyfall2019/110-fall2019/master/exercises/markupExercise/letter-text.html) to download the HTML file you'll need to mark up for the assessment. (Make sure you give the file an .html extension!)
