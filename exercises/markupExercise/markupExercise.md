# Basic HTML Markup Exercise (Week 7, Tuesday 9/10)

In today's exercise, you'll complete the Introduction to HTML on the Mozilla Developers Network (MDN) site. 

## Instructions
Complete the two assessments at the end of the Intro to HTML guide, using either VS Code or [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/). 

## Deliverables

Upload your completed HTML documents (just the .html pages you edited, not the accompanying files) to the myCourses Assignments dropbox by 3pm on Thursday. If you used Codepen.io, you can (a) copy and paste the HTML into an editor and save the resulting files, (b) export the pens and submit the HTML files in the src folders, or (c) provide the URLs to the pen.
