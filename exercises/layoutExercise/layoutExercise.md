# CSS Layout Exercise/Homework (Week 8, Thursday 10/17)

Today's exercise is to use CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to replicate the "Holy Grail" layout.

If you're having a hard time with flex and grid concepts, and you haven't already played the [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com) games, I suggest doing that before you start on your own grid.

These are the codepen examples I showed in class:
- [Simple Flexbox Wrapper](https://codepen.io/mamamusings/pen/wYKWbQ)
- [Full Viewport Grid](https://codepen.io/mamamusings/pen/MWWKzZQ)

Make sure you understand how to complete the grid we worked on in class before you move on to the exercise!

## Your Preliminary Web Project Grid

Once you've finished the grid we worked on in class, you should have a good sense of how to create a grid-based page. Use that knowledge to create an HTML/CSS grid for your planned website. 

Your grid should have a minimum of two rows and two columns. It should be constrained in width, using either pixels or % (so that it doesn't fill the browser window) and should be centered on the page using a flex-based wrapper. 


 
## Deliverables

Upload the HTML and CSS for your grid to the dropbox in myCourses by Saturday at noon. 

## FOR TUESDAY ##
Bring a full mockup of your website's proposed first page, done in Photoshop, Indesign, or a comparable program. At a minimum it should include your type, color, and image choices; ideally it will also show your basic content. You'll do critiques of these in class.
