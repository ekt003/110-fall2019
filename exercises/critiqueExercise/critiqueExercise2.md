# Critique Exercise 2 (Week 6)

Today you'll be repeating the critique process from Tuesday, with some slight differences.  

## Process

1. Take no more than ten minutes to individually review all of your group's covers, taking your own notes on what you think has improved from v1, and noting anything you think is particularly good, unclear, and/or still needs improvement.  
1. Divide the remaining minutes in the class by the number of group members present; that's how long you have to critique each project. Each group member should offer at least one positive comment about the work, and one suggestion for improvement. (You may also ask neutral questions about the work.) Everyone--including the creator--should take notes during this process. 
1. If you have time left after the critique process, you can begin work on your deliverables. 



## Deliverables

* Using the feedback from your group, create a final version of your magazine cover. 

* Create a document that includes the following components:
  - A description of the process you used to create your cover, make sure to address the design goals
  - An explanation of how the critique process shaped your revisions.   
  - Your critique notes for each of the covers your group reviewed
  
* Submit all three versions of your cover (the initial version, v2, and the final version) to the assignments dropbox in myCourses no later than noon on Monday of next week.
