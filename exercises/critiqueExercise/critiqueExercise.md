# Critique Exercise 1 (Week 6)

This week you'll be practicing critique skills. Remember that critique is best when it is constructive; use non-judgmental questions--"What was your goal for this work?" "What do you want people to notice first?", acknowledge positive aspects of the work, and provide concrete suggestions for improvement. 

You'll be doing this exercise in your note-taking groups, critiquing each person's magazine cover as a group.  

## Process

1. Upload your own magazine cover to your group's Google Drive folder. (I suggest creating a folder for this purpose.) Make sure your name is in the file name.
1. Have each person give the group a brief explanation of their goals and decision-making process for the cover, as well as any specific aspects of the work they're unhappy with or would like feedback on. Do *not* start the critique process yet--just take notes on what the creator tells you about the work. 
1. On your own, take no more than ten minutes to individually review all of your group's covers, taking your own notes on what you think is particularly good, unclear, and/or needs improvement.  
1. As a group, critique the covers. Each member of the group should offer at least one positive comment about the revised version, and at least one suggestion for improvement. (You may also ask neutral questions about the work.) Everyone--including the creator--should take notes during this process. 
1. The creator should avoid explaining or defending their design decisions; instead, focus on listening and understanding what people tell you. Ask clarifying questions if you want (e.g. "When you say you think it's too dark, what exactly do you mean?"), and take lots of notes. 


## Deliverables

* Write up your critique notes for each of the covers your group reviewed, and a summary of the comments on your own cover. Submit those notes to the Critique 1 assignment dropbox in myCourses no later than noon on Wednesday.  

* Using the feedback from your group, create a revised version of your magazine cover. Upload it to your group's folder before the start of class on Thursday, using the same file name with v2 added to the end.
