# Accessibility Exercise (Week 9, Thursday)

## Overview & Goals
Today you're going to evaluate web pages from two different sites, using the web-based version of [WebAIM's Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) or the [WebAIM WAVE Chrome extension](http://wave.webaim.org/extension/) keeping in mind the key issues discussed in today's lecture. 

## Accessibility Evaluation
Choose two different websites, and run a page from each through the accessibility evaluator.  In the document you just created, provide the URL for the page that you reviewed, and answer the following questions: What problems did it spot? How much of an impact could those problems have on a user with accessibility issues? How could those problems be addressed?  (If the page you chose has no accessibility issues, find another one!)

## Uploading and Due Date
Before noon on Saturday, upload the document to the Dropbox in myCourses.
