<h1 id="web-project-critique-exercise">Web Project Critique Exercise</h1>
<h2 id="before-class-mockupprototype-preparation">Before Class: Mockup/Prototype Preparation</h2>
<p>Before class on Thursday, prepare a mockup of your website. It can be a bare-bones HTML wireframe, or a paper prototype using one of the printable templates available here:</p>
<p>http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/free-printable-sketching-wireframing-templates/</p>
<p>Your mockup should include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A minimum of four pages (main page, two additional content pages, and a sources page)</li>
<li>General schematic of where elements will be on the page, including the title, text content, images, and navigation</li>
<li>At least one possible combination of colors and typefaces to be used on the site; these can be included as a swatch, a link to a color theme generating site like http://paletton.com, http://color.adobe.com or http://www.colourco.de/, or links to sites that use a similar design aesthetic.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="critique">Critique</h2>
<p>For the first 20 minutes of class, you will meet with your note-taking group to get critiques on your ideas thus far. Take notes on the feedback you get; you’ll need those to get credit for today’s exercise.</p>
<p>Once all of your group members have gotten their critiques from the group, spend the rest of the class modifying your mockup to address the suggestions. If your initial mockup was on paper, now is a good time to start building the HTML framework for your site, using CSS to position blocks of content.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-submit">What To Submit</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>A screenshot or photo of your initial mockup.</li>
<li>Your notes from the group critique.</li>
<li>A screenshot or photo of your revised mockup.</li>
</ol>
<p>Put all of those items into a single Word or PDF document, and upload the document to the Week 8 Exercise dropbox in myCourses no later than midnight tonight.</p>
