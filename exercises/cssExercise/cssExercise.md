# CSS Exercise (Week 7, Thursday 9/12)

In today's exercise, you'll complete a number of CSS guides on MDN, and then create a personal web page using what you've learned. 

## Instructions

Complete the following CSS Guides: 
 - [The Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)
 - [Backgrounds and Borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Backgrounds_and_borders)
 - [Overflowing Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content)
 - [Values and Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

Using the information from these guides, create a personal webpage for yourself that includes a photograph, at least two paragraphs of text, and a link to an external website. You should use at least one (but no more than two) Google Font, as demonstrated in lecture. 

Try to use the principles of design that we've discussed this semester!
 
## Deliverables

Upload your HTML document and the associated photograph (unless you're linking to a photo on another website) to the myCourses dropbox by noon on Saturday.
