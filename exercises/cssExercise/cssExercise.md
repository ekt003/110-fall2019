# CSS Exercise (Week 7, Thursday 10/10)

Today's exercise is to create a personal webpage using what you've learned about HTML and CSS thus far.  

## Instructions

Create a personal webpage for yourself that includes a photograph, at least two paragraphs of text, and a link to an external website. You should use at least one (but no more than two) [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), as demonstrated in lecture. (Reminder: from the Google Fonts page, click the red plus sign next to a font name to select it. Then click on the "family/families selected" bar at the bottom of the screen. Add the "link" code to the head of your HTML document; you can then use the font family name in your CSS. 

You can include your CSS rules as either a linked CSS file (better), or in a style tag in the head of your HTML file. 

Try to applt the principles of design that we've discussed this semester! 
 
## Deliverables

Upload the HTML file and any associated .css and image files to the myCourses Assignments dropbox by noon on Saturday.
