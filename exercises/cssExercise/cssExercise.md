# CSS Exercise (Week 7, Thursday 9/12)

Today's exercise is to create a personal webpage using what you've learned about HTML and CSS thus far.  

## Instructions

Using either Codepen.io or a desktop editor, create a personal webpage for yourself that includes a photograph, at least two paragraphs of text, and a link to an external website. You should use at least one (but no more than two) Google Font, as demonstrated in lecture. 

Try to use the principles of design that we've discussed this semester! You may also find these guides helpful as resources/references: 

 - [Backgrounds and Borders](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Backgrounds_and_borders)
 - [Overflowing Content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Overflowing_content)
 - [Values and Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)
 
## Deliverables

If you used codepen.io, you can submit just the URL for your work. If you used a desktop editor, upload your HTML document and the associated photograph (unless you're linking to a photo on another website) to the myCourses dropbox by noon on Saturday.
