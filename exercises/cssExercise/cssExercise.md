# CSS Exercise (Week 7, Thursday 10/10)

Today's exercise is to create a personal webpage using what you've learned about HTML and CSS thus far.  

## Instructions

Using either [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io) or a desktop editor, create a personal webpage for yourself that includes a photograph, at least two paragraphs of text, and a link to an external website. You should use at least one (but no more than two) [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), as demonstrated in lecture. (Reminder: from the Google Fonts page, click the red plus sign next to a font name to select it. Then click on the "family/families selected" bar at the bottom of the screen. Add the "link" code to the head of your HTML document; you can then use the font family name in your CSS. 

Try to use the principles of design that we've discussed this semester! You may also find these guides helpful as resources/references:

 - [Values and Units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)
 
## Deliverables

If you used codepen.io, you can submit just the URL for your work. If you used a desktop editor, upload your HTML document and the associated photograph (unless you're linking to a photo on another website) to the myCourses dropbox by noon on Saturday.
