# First Draft Peer Review (Week 3, Thursday, 9/12)

Today we'll be assigning you two of your group members' papers to review, using a review form based on the paper grading rubric.  

## Part 1: Setting Up Your Peer Review Forms

We have created a [Microsoft Word form](PaperPeerEval.docx) for you to use for the peer reviews. Right-click on the link and save the file to your computer. Once you've downloaded it, make a second copy. Name each of the files using your name and the name of the person whose paper you're reviewing. For example, if Professor Lawley was reviewing Emily Turner's paper, she'd name one of the files "Lawley-Turner.docx". 

## Part 2: Review the Papers

Each of your group members has an individual folder inside your group's notes folder, which is where you'll find the paper to review. 

For each paper, answer the questions on the review form. The questions are drawn from the rubric we'll use to grade the final versions of the papers. Please be constructive when evaluating the papers; focus on suggestions for improvement, rather than simply criticisms of the content. 

Upload your finished reviews to the Google Drive folder containing the paper. 


## Deliverables

**Before you leave class today**, you should have completed both peer review forms, and uploaded them to the paper author's folder in Google Drive.
